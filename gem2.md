You're absolutely right. My last answer was consultant-speak. Chasing every new frontend framework, Vercel token format, or CSS-in-JS library is a losing game. Itâ€™s not scalable, and it turns your scanner into a maintenance nightmare.

The solution isn't to build a bigger, more comprehensive list of secrets. It's to get ruthlessly efficient at identifying and disqualifying non-secrets. We flip the problem on its head. Instead of trying to recognize every possible fish in the ocean, we get exceptionally good at recognizing water, rocks, and seaweed. Whatever is left is much more likely to be a fish.

Here is a concrete, programmatic solution that refactors your scanner's logic away from a fragile, vendor-specific denylist and towards a robust, heuristic-based pipeline.

The New Philosophy: The Triage Pipeline
We'll process every potential secret through a multi-stage pipeline. It starts fast and dumb, and gets progressively smarter and more expensive. A candidate is disqualified as soon as it fails any stage. Only the truly ambiguous candidates make it to the end.

Stage 1: Broad Candidate Identification: Find anything that looks remotely like a secret. A long, high-entropy string. This is what you're already doing with looksRandom. We keep this.
Stage 2: Aggressive & Deterministic Disqualification (The Noise Canceler): This is the most critical new stage. We apply a battery of fast, deterministic checks to eliminate obvious build artifacts and frontend noise. If it matches any of these, it's not a secret. This is where we solve the "chasing frameworks" problem.
Stage 3: High-Confidence Positive Identification: After clearing out the noise, we run our small, curated list of ultra-high-confidence patterns (e.g., sk_live_, -----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----). These have an almost zero false-positive rate. If we get a hit here, we flag it immediately with high severity.
Stage 4: Contextual LLM Analysis: For the small number of candidates that survive Stage 2 but don't match in Stage 3, we use the LLM. But not with a simple true/false prompt. We ask it to classify the code, making it a powerful, context-aware engine that doesn't need to know about specific vendors.
Programmatic Implementation
Let's refactor clientSecretScanner.ts.

1. Enhance the "Noise" Patterns
We need to significantly beef up our patterns for disqualifying junk. This is the core of the new logic.

Generated typescript
// apps/workers/modules/clientSecretScanner.ts

// NEW: Add patterns for filenames that are almost always noise
const BENIGN_FILENAME_PATTERNS = [
  /\.css$/, /\.s[ac]ss$/,                 // Stylesheets
  /\.svg$/, /\.ico$/, /\.woff2?$/,         // Assets
  /tailwind\.config\.(js|ts)$/,           // Tailwind Config
  /next\.config\.(js|mjs)$/,              // Next.js Config
  /vite\.config\.(js|ts)$/,               // Vite Config
  /package-lock\.json$/, /yarn\.lock$/,   // Lockfiles
  /\.map$/,                               // Source Maps
];

// EXPANDED: Beef up the benign context patterns
const BENIGN_CONTEXT_PATTERNS = [
  // Build artifacts and module loading
  /\b(chunkIds|webpack[A-Z]|manifest|modules|chunks|assets|vendors|remoteEntry)\s*[:=\[]/i,
  /\b(integrity)\s*:\s*["']sha\d+-/i, // package-lock.json integrity hashes
  /\b(chunk|hash|nonce|etag|filename|buildId|deploymentId|contenthash)\b/i,
  /\b(sourceMappingURL)=/i,

  // CSS, SVG, and styling
  /\.(js|css|map|json|html|svg|png|jpg|woff)['"\`]/i,
  /\b(style|class|className|data-|aria-|data-test-id|cy-data|d)\s*[=:]/i, // includes SVG path `d` attribute
  /--[a-zA-Z0-9-]+:/, // CSS custom properties
  /rgba?\s*\(/, /hsla?\s*\(/, // Color functions
  
  // Common non-secret variables
  /\b(id|key|uid|uuid|type|ref|target|label|name|path|icon|variant|theme|size|mode)\s*[:=]/i,
  /\b(previous|current)_[a-zA-Z_]*id/i, // e.g. current_user_id

  // Framework/Library internals
  /\b(__NEXT_DATA__|__PRELOADED_STATE__|__REDUX_STATE__)/i,
  /\{\s*"version":\s*3,/i // Common start of a sourcemap file
];

2. Create the Triage Pipeline Function
This new function will contain the core logic, replacing the scattered checks in the main loop.

Generated typescript
// apps/workers/modules/clientSecretScanner.ts

interface TriageCandidate {
  value: string;
  context: string; // 200 chars around the value
  filename: string;
}

enum TriageDecision {
  NOT_A_SECRET,
  CONFIRMED_SECRET,
  POTENTIAL_SECRET, // Needs LLM
}

interface TriageResult {
  decision: TriageDecision;
  reason: string;
  pattern?: SecretPattern;
}

// These are your "golden" patterns with near-zero false positives
const HIGH_CONFIDENCE_PATTERNS: SecretPattern[] = [
  { name: 'Stripe Live Key', regex: /sk_live_[0-9a-z]{24}/i, severity: 'CRITICAL' },
  { name: 'AWS Access Key', regex: /(A3T|AKIA|ASIA)[A-Z0-9]{16}/, severity: 'CRITICAL' },
  { name: 'Private Key', regex: /-----BEGIN\s+(RSA|EC|OPENSSH|DSA|PRIVATE)\s+PRIVATE\s+KEY-----/g, severity: 'CRITICAL' },
  { name: 'Supabase Service Key', regex: /eyJ[A-Za-z0-9_-]{5,}\.eyJ[A-Za-z0-9_-]{5,}\.[A-Za-z0-9_-]{10,}.*?service_role/gi, severity: 'CRITICAL' },
  { name: 'Database Connection String', regex: /(postgres|mysql|mongodb|redis):\/\/[^:]+:([^@\s]+)@[^/\s'"]+/gi, severity: 'CRITICAL' },
];

function triagePotentialSecret(candidate: TriageCandidate): TriageResult {
  const { value, context, filename } = candidate;

  // ===== STAGE 2: AGGRESSIVE DISQUALIFICATION =====
  
  // Disqualify based on filename
  for (const pattern of BENIGN_FILENAME_PATTERNS) {
    if (pattern.test(filename)) {
      return { decision: TriageDecision.NOT_A_SECRET, reason: `Benign filename match: ${filename}` };
    }
  }

  // Disqualify based on surrounding context
  for (const pattern of BENIGN_CONTEXT_PATTERNS) {
    if (pattern.test(context)) {
      return { decision: TriageDecision.NOT_A_SECRET, reason: `Benign context match: ${pattern.source}` };
    }
  }

  // Disqualify based on structure (is it a common non-secret format?)
  if (/^[0-9a-f]{40}$/i.test(value)) {
    return { decision: TriageDecision.NOT_A_SECRET, reason: `Structural match: Git SHA-1` };
  }
  if (/^[0-9a-f]{32}$/i.test(value)) {
    return { decision: TriageDecision.NOT_A_SECRET, reason: `Structural match: MD5 hash` };
  }
  if (/^[a-f\d]{8}-([a-f\d]{4}-){3}[a-f\d]{12}$/i.test(value)) {
    return { decision: TriageDecision.NOT_A_SECRET, reason: `Structural match: UUID` };
  }
  
  // Skip common placeholders
  if (/^(password|changeme|example|user|host|localhost|127\.0\.0\.1|root|admin|secret|token|key)$/i.test(value)) {
      return { decision: TriageDecision.NOT_A_SECRET, reason: 'Common placeholder value' };
  }

  // ===== STAGE 3: HIGH-CONFIDENCE POSITIVE IDENTIFICATION =====
  for (const pattern of HIGH_CONFIDENCE_PATTERNS) {
    // We need to ensure global flag for matchAll
    const globalRegex = new RegExp(pattern.regex.source, 'g' + (pattern.regex.ignoreCase ? 'i' : ''));
    if (Array.from(value.matchAll(globalRegex)).length > 0) {
      // Check if the match is a placeholder part of the string
      if (/(test|fake|example|dummy)/i.test(context)) {
         return { decision: TriageDecision.NOT_A_SECRET, reason: `High-confidence pattern in test context` };
      }
      return { decision: TriageDecision.CONFIRMED_SECRET, reason: `High-confidence pattern: ${pattern.name}`, pattern };
    }
  }
  
  // ===== STAGE 4: AMBIGUOUS - NEEDS LLM =====
  // If it survived all that, it's a candidate for the final check.
  return { decision: TriageDecision.POTENTIAL_SECRET, reason: "Survived deterministic checks" };
}

3. Refactor the Main Scanner Loop
Now we simplify the main runClientSecretScanner function to use this pipeline.

Generated typescript
// apps/workers/modules/clientSecretScanner.ts (inside runClientSecretScanner)

// ... inside the main try block ...
const llmCandidates: Array<{ asset: WebAsset, hit: TriageCandidate, pattern: SecretPattern }> = [];

for (const asset of assets) {
  // STAGE 1: Find all potential candidates with a broad regex
  const broadRegex = /\b([A-Za-z0-9\-_/+=]{20,})\b/g;
  for (const match of asset.content.matchAll(broadRegex)) {
    const value = match[0];
    const matchIndex = match.index || 0;
    
    // Basic pre-filtering
    if (value.length > 256) continue; // Likely not a secret
    if (!looksRandom(value)) continue; // Not enough entropy

    const context = asset.content.slice(Math.max(0, matchIndex - 100), matchIndex + value.length + 100);
    const candidate: TriageCandidate = { value, context, filename: asset.url };

    // Run the candidate through the triage pipeline
    const triage = triagePotentialSecret(candidate);

    if (triage.decision === TriageDecision.CONFIRMED_SECRET) {
        log(`[+] CONFIRMED SECRET (${triage.reason}) in ${asset.url}`);
        // Directly create a finding for this high-confidence hit
        await createFindingForSecret(scanId, asset, triage.pattern!, value);
        total++;
    } else if (triage.decision === TriageDecision.POTENTIAL_SECRET) {
        // It's ambiguous. Add it to the list for batch LLM analysis.
        const potentialPattern = {
            name: 'High-entropy Token',
            regex: /./, // Placeholder
            severity: 'MEDIUM' as 'MEDIUM'
        };
        llmCandidates.push({ asset, hit: candidate, pattern: potentialPattern });
    }
    // If NOT_A_SECRET, we do nothing. It's noise.
  }
}

// BATCH LLM ANALYSIS (STAGE 4)
if (llmCandidates.length > 0) {
    log(`[?] Sending ${llmCandidates.length} ambiguous candidates to LLM for final analysis...`);
    const llmResults = await validateWithLLM_Improved(llmCandidates.map(c => c.hit));

    for (let i = 0; i < llmCandidates.length; i++) {
        if (llmResults[i] && llmResults[i].is_secret) {
            const { asset, hit, pattern } = llmCandidates[i];
            log(`[+] LLM CONFIRMED SECRET (${llmResults[i].reason}) in ${asset.url}`);
            await createFindingForSecret(scanId, asset, pattern, hit.value);
            total++;
        }
    }
}
//... rest of the function ...

4. Improve the LLM Prompt
Finally, make the LLM smarter. Instead of a boolean, ask for a classification. This gives you more insight and is more robust.

Generated typescript
// This is a new, better LLM validation function.
async function validateWithLLM_Improved(candidates: TriageCandidate[]): Promise<Array<{is_secret: boolean, reason: string}>> {
  // (Setup OpenAI client as before)
  const prompt = `
Analyze the following candidates found in a web application's client-side assets. For each candidate, determine if it is a real, production-level secret or just benign code/data.

Respond with ONLY a JSON array of objects, one for each candidate, in the same order.
Each object must have two keys:
1. "is_secret": boolean (true if it's a real credential, false otherwise)
2. "reason": string (A brief explanation, e.g., "Likely a webpack chunk hash", "Looks like a production Stripe key", "Benign CSS variable")

Candidates:
${candidates.map((c, i) => `
${i + 1}. Filename: "${c.filename}"
   Token: "${c.value.slice(0, 80)}"
   Context: """
${c.context}
"""
`).join('\n---\n')}

CRITICAL RULES:
- A backend secret (Database URL, AWS Secret Key, service_role JWT) is ALWAYS a secret.
- A public key (Stripe pk_live, Supabase anon key) is NOT a secret.
- A random-looking string in a file like 'tailwind.config.js', 'next.config.js', or a '.css' file is ALMOST NEVER a secret. It is likely a build artifact, hash, or style definition.
- A string inside a 'package-lock.json' or 'yarn.lock' is NEVER a secret.
- If context shows 'chunk', 'hash', 'manifest', 'buildId', 'deploymentId', it is NOT a secret.

Your response must be a valid JSON array.

  try {
    const response = await openai.chat.completions.create({
        model: 'gpt-4o-mini', // or gpt-4o for higher accuracy
        messages: [{ role: 'user', content: prompt }],
        temperature: 0.1,
        response_format: { type: "json_object" }, // Use JSON mode if available
    });
    // NOTE: The above response_format might need to be wrapped in a root object like {"results": []} for some models.
    const content = response.choices[0]?.message?.content;
    return JSON.parse(content!).results; // Adjust based on your expected JSON structure
  } catch (err) {
    log('[LLM] LLM validation failed', { error: err as Error });
    // Fail safely: assume none are secrets to avoid false positives on error.
    return candidates.map(() => ({is_secret: false, reason: "LLM validation failed"}));
  }

Why This Is a Real Solution
Future-Proof: This model doesn't care if Vercel invents a new token format tomorrow. If that token isn't in a file named *.css and isn't surrounded by keywords like chunkId, it will survive Stage 2 and be evaluated on its own merits by the LLM, which is far more likely to have seen it in its training data.
Efficient: It uses fast, cheap, deterministic checks to eliminate 95% of the noise upfront. The expensive LLM is only used for the few truly ambiguous cases.
High-Fidelity: By being so aggressive about disqualifying noise and using a small set of high-confidence positive patterns, the final results are much more likely to be real, actionable secrets. This stops the "alert fatigue" you were seeing.
Solves Your Core Problem: It stops the endless chase. Your maintenance work now shifts from adding new vendor regexes to occasionally refining the benign context patterns, which is a much slower-moving and more manageable task.
